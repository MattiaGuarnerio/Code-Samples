    "Since the data gathering process takes a lot of time, I gather the Bill Metadata in this separate script, which I will let run on the Microsoft Azure ML cloud during the Supervised Machine Learning steps. I only need them for the Data Analysis steps anyway, so this will allow me to optimise my working schedule. As I have saved the bill numbers for the House of Representatives and the Senate in the `bill_numbers_house.json` and `bill_numbers_senate.json` files, I will be able to make my requests without getting the unique bill identifiers again."

    "The data collection procedure went smoothly, yet not perfectly. The `bill_metadata_house.jsonl` and `bill_metadata_senate.jsonl` files do not contain metadata for all bills. In fact, the `metadata_diagnostics.jsonl` file shows that 76 documents were not correctly retrieved. I will take care of these rogue bills in a separate script and attach them to the final metadata dataset, if possible. I must note that, analogously to the other data collection procedures, I had to use the `json` package, and not the `jsonlines` package, because the latter appears to not be available within Microsoft Azure ML. Moreover, the output was not printed because I let the process run on the server end. If requested, I can show that the script indeed runs as expected."
