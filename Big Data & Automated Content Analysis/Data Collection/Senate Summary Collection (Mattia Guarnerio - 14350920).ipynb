    "Since the data gathering process takes a lot of time, I gather the Senate Summary Data in this separate script, which I will let run on Azure ML. This will allow me to optimise my working schedule, and help me avoiding connection issues. As I have saved the bill numbers for the House of Representatives and the Senate in the `bill_numbers_house.json` and `bill_numbers_senate.json` files, I will be able to make my requests without getting the unique bill identifiers again."

    "On a final note, one may observe that the `/summaries/{congress}/{billType}` API endpoint could have saved a lot of time, since I could have paginated over the .JSON responses, getting multiple bills per request, instead of fetching one bill per request. However, the endpoint does not work, and this forces me to go for the long and hard way. The reason why I used the `json`, and not the `jsonlines` library, is that the latter appears to be unavailable on Microsoft Azure ML, the environment on which I ran the script. There is no diagnostics file, and all data was retrieved! I now turn to data cleaning."
